  abstract:
    "When he died, amid the political and social upheaval of the Mexican Revolution, the artist José Guadalupe Posada (1852–1913) left behind an enormous body of work. A commercial illustrator, Posada created designs that appeared in advertisements, periodicals, cookbooks, children’s books, and, most famously, on the brightly-colored penny broadsheets sold primarily to the working class in and around Mexico City. The New York Public Library’s Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photographs holds over 600 items and is one of the largest collections of original Posada prints outside Mexico.",
